    "- Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.\n",
    "    - Because a coin's getting flipped, there's an equal chance of getting heads or tails. Since the coin needs to be flipped four times to make the pattern, the probability equation is (0.5)(0.5)(0.5)(0.5), with a 6.25% chance of getting the pattern HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.\n",

    "    - The probability that Bernice will be in a plane crash can be found with this equation: P(Bernice flying n plance crash) = P(bernice flying) * P(plane crash) = (0.1) * (0.005) = 0.0005%, so Bernice has 0.0005% chance of being in a plane crash sometime in the next year.\n",
