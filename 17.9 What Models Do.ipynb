    "1. Try to model the result of a coin toss. In your model, include any features that you think important in explaining the result. Discuss with your mentor about the pros and cons of adding too many features into your model.\n",

In data science, this is an example of the so-called recommendations systems. Read this nontechnical blog post of __[Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639)__ about how they model their recommendations systems. Then, derive the features they use in their recommendations engines and discuss what else can be incorporated into this model."
