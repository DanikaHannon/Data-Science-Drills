Once you're done, you can compare your answers to the ones found in [this notebook](https://tf-assets-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/tf-curric/data-science/machine-learning-regression/solutions/1.solution_what_is_regression.ipynb), which you can download.\n",

    "1. Let's assume that you have World Bank data on financial, economic and social indicators for several countries. You want to measure the factors that affect the level of development in these countries. To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population. You want to use some features in your dataset to predict per capita income. Is this task a classification or a regression task? Why?\n",

    "    - OLS is a special type of linear regression models\n",
    "    - Regression models become useless if they don’t meet the assumptions of linear regression.\n",
    "    - Estimation and prediction are the same thing in the context of linear regression models.\n",
